interactive data applications, video conferencing) can be affected by much lower delays.
The effects of delays below 500 ms on conversational speech are estimated using a curve derived
from the E-model (ITU-T Rec. G.107).

The experiment also contains Opus codec conditions (as used in OTT VoLTE services) and legacy codecs in mobile networks as AMR and AMR-WB. P.863 predicts the subject scores reliably, without significant bias for any coding scheme.
The experimental design was following the so-called P.OLQA full-scale rules, but extended to mixed fullband. The P.863 predictions follow this scale interpretation very nicely and linear. There is no mapping required.},
